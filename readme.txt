== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to setup the front page like the demo site? =

The demo site URL: http://blaskdemo.wordpress.com/?demo

When you first activate Blask, your homepage will display posts in a traditional blog format. If you'd like to use the Portfolio Page Template instead, follow these steps:

1. Create or edit a page, and then assign it the Portfolio Page Template from the Page Attributes module.
2. Go to Settings > Reading and set "Front page displays" to "A static page".
3. Select the page you just assigned the Portfolio Page template to as "Front page" and then choose another page as "Posts page" to serve your blog posts.

Now that you have set your home page, you can start customizing by navigating to Customize → Theme Options.

Full Front Page setup instructions can be found at https://theme.wordpress.com/themes/blask/

= How to set up Portfolio? =

Blask takes advantage of the Jetpack's Portfolio feature (http://jetpack.com/support/custom-content-types/), offering unique layouts and organization for your portfolio projects. To add a project, go to Portfolio → Add New in your WP Admin dashboard.

# Projects #

Make sure the images you include in your projects are at least 880px wide. Blask displays these images at full width on larger screens.

Be sure to add a featured image to your projects as well. Although it won’t be displayed in single project view, it’s used on the portfolio archives page

# Portfolio archives page #

All projects are displayed on the portfolio archive page in grid layout. This page can be added to a Custom Menu using the Links Panel.

The portfolio archive page can be found at http://mygroovysite.wordpress.com/portfolio/ — just replace http://mygroovysite.wordpress.com/ with the URL of your website.


== Quick Specs (all measurements in pixels) ==

1. The main column width is 640.
2. A widget in the Footer Widget Area is 300.
3. Featured Images for posts should be at least 880 wide.
